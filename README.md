## DeepBook Maxi

It allows user to earn high yield using DeepBook. In the hackathon, we have used The Stoikov Market Maker strategy, which places bid and ask prices based on factors like initial stock price, spread, total balance, volatility, and a user-defined profit target. This is also a proven strategy in traditional finance which can now be used through order books (deepbook) in SUI network.

This will also be greatly beneficial to SUI network as it will incentivize liquidity providers to provide more liquidity DeepBook (or on SUI network), hence increasing its TVL. As the TVL grows, SUI will attract more developers and web3 enthusiastics, hence making it a win-win solution.
